# Chat State Persistence Solution

## Problem
The floating chatbot was losing its conversation state when navigating between pages because each page navigation created a new component instance, resetting the chat messages.

## Solution
Implemented a global React Context to manage chat state across the entire application, ensuring conversations persist during navigation.

## Implementation

### 1. Global Chat Context (`context/ChatContext.jsx`)
- Created `ChatContext` using React Context API
- Manages all chat state globally:
  - Messages array
  - Chat open/closed state
  - Loading state
  - Schema and date selections
  - Notification state
- Provides actions for chat interactions:
  - `toggleChatbot()` - Open/close chat
  - `handleSendMessage()` - Send new messages
  - `clearChat()` - Reset conversation
- Uses `sessionStorage` for persistence across page navigation

### 2. Updated Components

#### ChatProvider Wrapper
- Wraps the entire application in `layout.js`
- Provides chat state to all child components
- Initializes conversation memory once globally

#### FloatingChatbot_new.jsx
- Simplified component using `useChat()` hook
- No local state management
- Consumes global chat state and actions
- Maintains same UI and functionality

#### ChatInterface_new.jsx
- Updated main chat interface to use global state
- Both floating and main chat interfaces stay in sync
- Same conversation appears in both views

### 3. Key Features

#### State Persistence
- ✅ Chat messages persist across page navigation
- ✅ Open/closed state maintained
- ✅ Schema and date selections preserved
- ✅ Notification state managed globally

#### Synchronized Interfaces
- ✅ Floating chatbot and main chat page show same conversation
- ✅ Messages sent in either interface appear in both
- ✅ Schema selections sync between interfaces

#### Memory Management
- ✅ Uses existing `conversationMemory.js` for sessionStorage
- ✅ Conversation persists until tab is closed
- ✅ Automatic cleanup on session end

## File Changes

### New Files
- `context/ChatContext.jsx` - Global chat state manager
- `components/FloatingChatbot_new.jsx` - Updated floating chatbot
- `components/ChatInterface_new.jsx` - Updated main chat interface

### Modified Files
- `app/layout.js` - Added ChatProvider wrapper
- `app/chat/page.js` - Uses new ChatInterface
- `components/ConditionalFloatingChatbot.jsx` - Uses new FloatingChatbot

### Architecture
```
App Layout (ChatProvider)
├── Header
├── Main Content (children)
├── FloatingChatbot (conditional)
└── Footer

ChatProvider provides:
├── Chat State (messages, isOpen, etc.)
├── Chat Actions (send, toggle, clear)
└── Persistence (sessionStorage integration)
```

## Benefits
1. **Seamless Navigation**: Users can navigate between pages without losing chat context
2. **Unified Experience**: Same conversation appears in both floating and main chat interfaces
3. **Performance**: Single state management reduces re-renders
4. **Maintainability**: Centralized chat logic is easier to manage
5. **User Experience**: No frustrating conversation resets when browsing

## Usage
The solution is automatically active. Users can:
- Start a conversation on any page using the floating chatbot
- Navigate to other pages and continue the same conversation
- Visit the dedicated chat page to see the same conversation in full interface
- Clear chat history from either interface to reset both

The conversation persists until the browser tab is closed or the user explicitly clears the chat.
