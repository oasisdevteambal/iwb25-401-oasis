## 📝 Example Response Formats

### Before:

Here is what we currently have in our knowledge base for this tax type. The PAYE tax type is an income tax. It uses tax brackets. Two formulas are used. Four variables are required.
```

### After:
```
## 💰 PAYE Tax Overview

Great question! **PAYE (Pay As You Earn)** is Sri Lanka's monthly income tax system 🇱🇰

### How it works:
• **Automatic deduction** from your monthly salary 💸
• **Progressive brackets** - different rates for different income levels 📊  
• **Employer responsibility** - they handle calculations and payments 🏢

### What we have in our system:
1. **Tax brackets** with different rates for income ranges
2. **Calculation formulas** for precise tax computation
3. **Required variables** for accurate assessments

Would you like me to show you the specific brackets or explain how the calculations work? 🤔
